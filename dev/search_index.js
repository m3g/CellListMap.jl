Therefore, it is frequent that it is not worthwhile (actually it is detrimental for performance) to split the construction of the cell lists in too many threads. This is particularly relevant for smaller systems, for which the cost of constructing the lists can be comparable to the cost of actually computing the mapped function. \n\nAt the same time, the homogeneity of the computation of the mapped function may be fast or not, homogeneous or not. These characteristics affect the optimal workload splitting strategy. For very large systems, or systems for which the function to be computed is not homogeneous in time, it may be interesting to split the workload in many tasks as possible, such that slow tasks do not dominate the final computational time.   \n\nBoth the above considerations can be used to tunning the nbatches parameter of the cell list. This parameter is initialized from a tuple of integers, defining the number of batches that will be used for constructing the cell lists and for the mapping of the computations. \n\nBy default, the number of batches for the computation of the cell lists is smaller than nthreads() if the number of particles per cell is small.

Thus, no more than 8 batches are used by default, to avoid delays associated to data copying and garbage collection. The number of batches of the mapping function uses an heuristic which currently limits somewhat the number of batches for small systems, when the overhead of spawning tasks is greater than the computation.  Using more batches than threads for the function mapping is effective most times in avoiding uneven workload, but it may be a problem if the output to be reduced is too large, as the threaded version of the output contains nbatches copies of the output. \n\nUsing less batches than the number of threads also allows the efficient use of nested multi-threading, as the computations will only use the number of threads required, leaving the other threads available for other tasks.\n\nThe number of batches is set on the construction of the cell list, using the nbatches keyword parameter.

There is a trade-off between the number of cells and the number of particles per cell. For low-density systems, greater meshes are better, because each cell will have only a few particles and the computations loop over a smaller number of cells. For dense systems, it is better to run over more cells with less particles per cell. It is a good idea to test different values of lcell to check which is the optimal choice for your system. Usually the best value is lcell=1, because in CellListMap implements a method to avoid spurious computations of distances on top of the cell lists, but for very dense systems, or for very large cutoffs (meaning, for situations in which the number of particles per cell may be very large), a greater lcell may provide a better performance. It is unlikely that lcell > 3 is useful in any practical situation. For molecular systems with normal densities lcell=1 is likely the optimal choice. The performance can be tested using the progress meter, as explained below.  \n\nAs a rough guide, lcell > 1 is only worthwhile if the number of particles per cell is greater than  ~200-400.  \n\nnote: Note\nThe number of cells in which the particles will be classified is, for each dimension lcell*length/cutoff.

Naively, a loop over all pair of particles is written as:\n\nfor i in 1:N\n    for j in i+1:N\n        # compute distance, possibly considering periodic boundary conditions\n        d = distance(particle[i],particle[j]) \n        if d <= cutoff \n            # compute property dependent on d\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nwhere N is the number of particles. \n\nAlternatively, if the interaction is between two disjoint sets of particles, the naive loop is\n\nfor i in 1:N \n    for j in 1:M\n        # compute distance, possibly considering periodic boundary conditions\n        d = distance(first_set[i], second_set[j])\n        if d <= cutoff\n            # compute property dependent on d\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nwhere N and M are the numbers of particles of each set. If the cutoff is significantly smaller than the dimension of the system, these loops are very expensive, and it is possible to avoid looping over particles that are farther from each other than the cutoff.\n\nCellListMap implements an efficient and parallel cell-list method, with optimizations, to substitute such double-loops while taking into account periodic boundary conditions. Cell lists are an alternative to distance trees and are particularly effective when the distribution of the particles is roughly homogeneous. For highly heterogeneous systems distance trees like those implemented in  NearestNeighbors.jl might be more performant.
